Here’s the structured solution for each problem in both **JavaScript** and **Python**, following your request.

### **1. Two Sum**  
#### Problem  
Given an array of integers `nums` and an integer `target`, return indices of the two numbers such that they add up to `target`.

---

#### **Solution**

##### JavaScript
```javascript
function twoSum(nums, target) {
    const map = new Map();
    for (let i = 0; i < nums.length; i++) {
        const complement = target - nums[i];
        if (map.has(complement)) {
            return [map.get(complement), i];
        }
        map.set(nums[i], i);
    }
    return [];
}
```

##### Python
```python
def two_sum(nums, target):
    num_map = {}
    for i, num in enumerate(nums):
        complement = target - num
        if complement in num_map:
            return [num_map[complement], i]
        num_map[num] = i
    return []
```

---

#### **Way of Approach**
1. Use a hash map to store the indices of numbers as we iterate.
2. For each number, check if its complement (i.e., `target - num`) exists in the map.
3. If the complement exists, return its index and the current index.

---

#### **Interview Explanation**
"As we iterate through the array, we maintain a hash map where keys are numbers and values are their indices. When we encounter a number, we check if its complement (target - number) is already in the map. If it is, we return the indices. This approach ensures we find the solution in a single pass with a time complexity of O(n)."

---

#### **Description**
The solution leverages a hash map for constant-time lookups, allowing us to efficiently find the two indices. Instead of using a nested loop (O(n²)), we achieve optimal performance with a single traversal of the array.
